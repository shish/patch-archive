Thanks a lot for your patch!!

But I think there is a missing thing. The get_rc_file do only what it
says : it populate the key array from the configuration file. We have
to first ungrab all keys, then load the new configuration file (C or
scheme) and then grab again all new keys.

This can be done simply with the catch_HUP_signal function.
So the part

// if the rc file has been modified, reload it
stat(rc_file, &rc_file_info);
if(rc_file_info.st_mtime != rc_file_changed)
  {
   get_rc_file();
   rc_file_changed = rc_file_info.st_mtime;
  }

simply become :


// if the rc file has been modified, reload it
stat(rc_file, &rc_file_info);
if(rc_file_info.st_mtime != rc_file_changed)
  {
   catch_HUP_signal (1);    // <- here
   rc_file_changed = rc_file_info.st_mtime;
  }


Again, thanks a lot, this will be in the new version of xbindkeys.
